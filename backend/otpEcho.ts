// Session 43 (Ravi: "the email code is already filled in on the verify screen — app and website").
// The code was echoed to the browser whenever PAYMENT test mode was on, and payment test mode is
// on for every *.run.app deploy — so the live server handed out every signup / login / signing
// code. Anyone could type someone's email on "Continue with OTP" and log in.
// Now: an OTP is returned to the browser (or written to the logs) ONLY on a non-production server
// (local dev, tests, AI Studio preview). Payment test mode, APP_URL and Resend fallbacks no longer
// matter. `OTP_ECHO=off` turns it off even there.
