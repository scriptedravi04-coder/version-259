# 🗄️ NO NEW DATABASE CHANGES RIGHT NOW (Ravi, session 41)

We are only fixing the app's bugs and errors. **Do not create any Supabase table, column, bucket or SQL
file, and do not build features that need one.** If something needs the database, write it in
`PENDING_DB_CHANGES.md` (what / why / which code) and tell Ravi. All of it is done together in one
dedicated database session.

# 🔒 LOCKED: Campaign, UGC, Invite-to-campaign (Ravi, session 28)

These three flows work end to end and launch is close. **Do not change their logic.**
- Logic files (backend routes, deal/chat/contract/payment code, `dealState.js`, `useChatThreadMobile.js`, …)
  are frozen — list in `scripts/protectedFlows.mjs` → `LOGIC_FILES`. Not one character.
- Screen files of these flows (chat cards, mobile sheets, manage-orders, campaign / invite pages) may get a
  new design, but every server call they make must stay exactly the same (same method, same path).
- `npm run verify` fails (`backend/protectedFlows.test.ts`) if either rule is broken. Undo your change.
- **Never** run `npm run protect:update`, edit `scripts/protected/manifest.json`, shorten the lists, or edit
  that test yourself. Only when Ravi approves a specific change in writing; it is logged in `PROTECTED_CHANGES.md`.
- Mobile UI work: change layout / styling / text only. Need a new server call or a logic change? Stop and ask Ravi.

# 🛑 FIRST: read `ARCHITECTURE.md` → "PROTECTED CHANGES"

Security, money and privacy fixes in this app must not be undone. Before finishing any change run
`npm run verify`; never edit or delete a test to make it pass. If a requested change needs one of
the protected rules changed, stop and ask the user.

The full list, with the reason for each rule and the test that guards it, is at the top of `ARCHITECTURE.md`.


## Loading states
Follow ARCHITECTURE.md "Loading states" (rule 35) in every new screen: button actions use `useBusy` + `<ButtonSpinner />` (never `startLoading()`), page data uses `ContentSkeletons`, the global loader stays a 2px top bar. Do not bring back the full-screen blurred loader or a big wordmark.

UGC cancels never refund through Razorpay: a creator cancel keeps the money in the brief and relists the slot; a brand order-cancel (24h+, no draft) goes to the manual Admin → UGC Refunds queue. See ARCHITECTURE.md rules 51–52 before touching `/ugc/orders/:id/cancel`.
