// Session 20. Who may set or change a user's role, and when.
//
// Before: `/auth/onboard` never wrote `users.role` at all, and `/auth/role` wrote only the
// local JSON store (never Supabase) and let anyone switch to any role at any time. A Google
// sign-up is created with `role: null`, so a brand that signed up with Google finished brand
// onboarding (brand_profiles row and all) and the server still did not see them as a brand:
// "Only brands can post campaigns".
//
// The rule, in one place:
//   - no role yet                          → take the requested role
//   - same role                            → nothing to change
//   - different role, not onboarded yet    → take the requested role (wrong tab at sign-up)
//   - different role, already onboarded    → refuse (a creator must not turn into a brand,
//                                             or the reverse, by calling an endpoint)
//   - admin / sub_admin                    → never changed here
